The reason why I choose to make this is because a lot of people put their old books in the basement or in the attic. 
However most basement are too humid to store books in while the temperature in the attic can be too high, especially during the summer.
The temperature, humidity and luminance are measured using different types of sensors. 
When a certain temperature is reached, the fan will automatically start.
Using the keypad, the lock can be opened.
